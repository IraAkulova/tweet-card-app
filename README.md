This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

A personal backend was created for development using the UI service mockapi.io. User cards are implemented according to the layout. When you click on the Follow button, the text changes to Following. The color of the button also changes. And your number of followers is also added. When the page is updated, the final result of the user's actions is fixed. When you click the button again, its text and color change to their original state. The number of followers also changes. Also added routing using React Router.
